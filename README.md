# Maze solver
This is a (simple?) Python program to find the shortest path between a start point and an end point in a maze. It is an example of a **breadth-first search** algorithm. This means it iterates over paths of the same length until it finds the exit. (You can imagine searching a tree by row, as opposed to a depth-first search which searches a tree by following each path to the end.)
